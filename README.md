# GAT Experiments

:construction: **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** :construction:

Analyzing how the Attention mechanism in GAT networks can be used to optimize algorithms for processing, clustering, and analysis in Graphs.

The aim of this project is to explore the applications of the Attention mechanism in graph processing, understanding how it can be valuable for community detection, clustering tasks, and graph optimization.

Several existing research papers touch upon this concept, and our goal is to use them as a foundation to propose new algorithms and variations that can bring innovation to this research area.

So far, the approach that has piqued our interest the most is using Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with Graph Attention for community detection. Here, GAE helps identify clusters in the input graph and leverages the Attention mechanism to assess the significance of this information.
